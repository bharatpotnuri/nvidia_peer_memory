1. Overview
===============================================================================

General:
-----------
MLNX_OFED 2.1 introduces an API between IB CORE to peer memory clients, such as NVIDIA Kepler class GPU's, (e.g. GPU cards), also known as GPUDirect RDMA.  It provides access for the HCA to read/write peer memory data buffers, as a result it allows RDMA-based applications to use the peer device computing power with the RDMA interconnect without the need for copying data to host memory.  

This capability is supported with Mellanox ConnectX-3 VPI or Connect-IB InfiniBand adapters.  It will also work seemlessly using RoCE technology with the Mellanox ConnectX-3 VPI adapters.

This README describes the required steps to completing the installation for the NVIDIA peer memory client with Mellanox OFED.


Content:
-----------
This tarball contains 3 files:
1) README.txt
2) nvidia-peer-memory_1.0.orig.tar.gz for Ubuntu
3) nvidia_peer_memory-1.0-0.src.rpm for other operating systems


===============================================================================
Installation
===============================================================================

Pre-requisites:
1) NVIDIA compatible driver is installed and up.
2) MLNX_OFED 2.1 is installed and up.

For the required NVIDIA driver and other relevant details in that area
please check with NVIDIA support.


To install run (excluding ubuntu):
                rpmbuild --rebuild <path to srpm>.
                rpm -ivh <path to generated binary rpm file.> [On SLES add --nodeps].
				

To install on Ubuntu run:
          copy tarball to temp directory.
          tar xzf <tarball>
          cd <extracted directory>
          dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
          dpkg -i <path to generated deb files.>

		  (e.g. dpkg -i nvidia-peer-memory_1.0-0_all.deb 
		       dpkg -i nvidia-peer-memory-dkms_1.0-0_all.deb)

After successful installation:
1)	nv_peer_mem.ko is installed
2)	service file /etc/init.d/nv_peer_mem to be used for start/stop/status
	for that kernel module was added.
3)	/etc/infiniband/nv_peer_mem.conf to control whether kernel module will be loaded on boot
	(default is YES) was added.

Notes
===============================================================================

To achieve good performance both the NIC and the GPU must physically sit on same i/o root complex,
use lspci -tv to make sure that this is the case.
